 of historic images. Since the beginning in 2011 the platform focused on ge
 otagging and rephotography (then and now picture pairs). The aim is to ena
 ble map based access to historic pictorial content (instead of the usual t
 extual search). Ajapaik has 175000 images\, 106000 have been geotagged by 
 users who have also submitted more than 16000 rephotographs. The talk will
  share our experience and prospects of how to use this data further.\n\nVa

DESCRIPTION:Important aspects of cartography\, like generalisation\, are us
 ually mostly overlooked in today's on-line maps. Some of these problems ar
 e being solved using open source tools while creating a vector tile based 
 on-line map topo.openmap.lt. Cartography helps to improve not only the vis
 ual\, but also the technical result of vector tiles and therefore the maps
  themselves. Although some solutions are already implemented\, a lot of ot
 her issues are missing even ideas for high level algorithm to be used to s
 olve them.\n\nHead of Productivity engineering department at iTree Group w

DESCRIPTION:Today many organizations are searching for effective solutions 
 that will help to minimise the cost for on the spot monitoring - some are 
 using drones\, others satellite images and the third ones are using a mix 
 of different solutions. But is entirely automated monitoring even possible
 ? CGI Estonia has been working in cooperation with Estonian Agricultural a
 nd Registers Board to find solutions for this problem. During the presenta
 tion an overview will be given about the concept of automatic monitoring\,
  the applications/tools that are already in use or potentially coming into
  use and different challenges we have encountered.\n\nKreet is an GIS enth

DESCRIPTION:We believe that production and maintenance of topographic data 
 is convenient\, fast and with less human error. Currently\, a lot of time 
 and human resources are spent checking the logic of topographic plans and 
 their compliance with the specification. Therefore\, we have created a Top
 ographic Information Verification and Management Platform that provides th
 e user for ease of use\, adaptability\, and increased productivity in topo
 graphic information verification and maintenance. The Topoweb.lv platform 
 provides the verification of topographic and related data\, the maintenanc
 e of data in the database and its release to users. We will present the cu
 rrent solutions and future development plans.\n\nMaris Krievs has been a M
 ember of the Board for TopoDati since 2014. Under Maris’s guidance\, the
  development of a topographic data maintenance system was started. It did 
 not take long when a service for automated verification of topographic dat
 a specification was offered in 2016. In 2017\, automated release of data o
 n territories of interest was introduced. In 2019\, a topographic data log
 ic verification system was introduced. In addition\, a system has been dev
 eloped for checking / comparing the survey data on public utilities agains

 - How the ESA Business Incubation Network across Europe every year support
