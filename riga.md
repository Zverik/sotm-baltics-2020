Riga! The Europe's Wifi capital!
But of course there is plenty [more to see](https://www.liveriga.com/en/):
amazing historic facades, cobblestone roads, a river half
a kilometer in width with astonishing views. Fish. Anything to
please a traveller, and we haven't even started on a brand new
venue the conference will be in. Do come here. You've got plenty of options.

# Getting Here

State-owned AirBaltic is your airline of choice: Riga (RIX) is the hub for
this relatively low-cost airline. It offers direct flights from most
European and Middle-East capitals, including Berlin, London, Brussels,
Budapest, Moscow, and Kyiv. Of course you should consult your flight
booking website of choice for a possibility of a cheaper flight: e.g.
while MOW→RIX with AirBaltic costs 100 €, Aeroflot does the same flight
for just 85 €.

Others options of getting to Riga include
a [ferry](https://www.tallinksilja.com/en/latvia-riga) from Stockholm,
Lux Express [buses](https://www.luxexpress.eu/en/routes/) from nearby countries,
daily [trains](http://pass.rzd.ru/static/public/ru?STRUCTURE_ID=5125&layer_id=3290&refererLayerId=162&id=2369)
from Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Pskov, driving, or hiring a private yacht.
[See details](https://www.liveriga.com/en/10-arrival) on the official
tourist website.

If you live nearby, there is a chance somebody from the OSM community
will be travelling the same direction, and you could share the costs.

# University of Latvia

Continuing the streak from SotM Baltics 2013, we are hosting this
conference in a top-ten university in the Baltic States: The University
of Latvia. More precisely, in its [Academic Centre](https://www.akademiskaiscentrs.lu.lv/en/),
which is being finished the time you're reading this.

Details on how to get there will follow. For now, use
[Jelgavas iela 1](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=56.93666&mlon=24.09727#map=18/56.93666/24.09727)
for the destination address in your app.

To get to the centre, take:

* a tram: 600 m walk from the "Nacionālā bibliotēka" stop, trams 1, 2, 5, 10.
* a bus: same stop for buses 3, 4, 7, 8, 21, 22, 25, 32,
    or a closer one — "LU Akadēmiskais centrs" for bus 23 from the bus and train stations.
* a taxi: [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/cities/riga/) and [Yandex.Taxi](https://taxi.yandex.lv/)
    are available, no Uber.
* or even a train: costs 0.70 € to "Torņakalns" station, from there
    it's a 900 m walk. Don't forget your OsmAnd or MAPS.ME app to not get lost!
