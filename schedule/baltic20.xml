        <description>EUROGI, the European Umbrella Organisation for Geographic Information, seeks to promote the widespread and effective use of geospatial information and technologies. It has a forward looking, futures orientation in much of its thinking and in this regard it is aware that over the past few decades the technological and market/institutional environment has changed considerably since the Spatial Data Infrastructure paradigm was first developed. The ‘Beyond SDIs’ presentation which Bruce will present will provide some thoughts which could possibly lead to the development of a new paradigm. In the presentation Bruce will mention some geospatial though leaders’ views on this Beyond SDIs theme.

Bruce is a professional town and regional planner who has worked for many years as a planner in both South Africa and Ireland. He represented Ireland in discussions regarding the development of the INSPIRE Directive and for a period chaired the Irish Spatial Data Infrastructure Work Group. He is Past President of EUROGI and is currently the President of IRLOGI, the Irish Organisation for Geographic Information. Bruce is currently on the Executive Committee of EUROGI.</description>

        <description>Today many organizations are searching for effective solutions that will help to minimise the cost for on the spot monitoring - some are using drones, others satellite images and the third ones are using a mix of different solutions. But is entirely automated monitoring even possible? CGI Estonia has been working in cooperation with Estonian Agricultural and Registers Board to find solutions for this problem. During the presentation an overview will be given about the concept of automatic monitoring, the applications/tools that are already in use or potentially coming into use and different challenges we have encountered.

        <description>For the past decade JSC Latvia’s State Forests has developed geospatial information technology platform LVM GEO, used not only for managing more than half of Latvia’s forests, but also for mapping waterbodies, managing agriculture lands, maintaining roads and analyzing spread of diseases. One the most challenging projects for the LVM GEO development team has been implementation of the LVM GEO platform for AS Augstsprieguma tikls (AST) – the independent electricity transmission system operator in Latvia. In his presentation Maris will be sharing our experience, challenges and successes in implementing a fully functional platform in production for AST in less than 6 months.

Maris is the geospatial information technology business founder and manager at the JSC Latvia's State Forests with many years and projects experience in the industry. He is a board member of Latvia’s GIS Association and is actively involved in geospatial information policy development, drives the open geospatial data movement and stimulates industry stakeholders to collaborate and develop sustainable solutions and projects.</description>

        <description>Recycling plants carry out work with large-scale objects that require extensive storage space. In order for warehouse workers to be able to quickly navigate their work environment, it is necessary to know a precise location of different objects, humans and machinery. Indoor mapping allows you to position objects and people in closed environments. The presentation will provide an insight into the solution used by the largest group of environmental management companies in the Baltic.

        <description>Organizations today are faced with what we call “the Geo-Ops Challenge,” or the gap between the geospatial world — the acquisition, processing, management, and distribution of mapping data — and the operational world — taking this data and analyzing it to take action. And it’s not just traditional geospatial data anymore, but also real-time feeds from dozens of sensors that provide video, pollution, traffic, people flow, and even crowd-sourcing data. In this complex and connected world, conventional GIS no longer suffices. Hexagon Geospatial solutions link data acquisition with action by interconnecting the geospatial and operational worlds. Customers of all sizes – from sites to cities to nations – use 5D location intelligence to solve real-world, real-time, mission-critical challenges.

Alexander Tasev is the Partner Manager Eastern Europe &amp; CIS. He has been promoting and implementing Geospatial / BIM technologies for over twenty years. Today, Alexander is working with Hexagon Geospatial partners to help customers from state and local governments, commercial and non-profit organizations to leverage the power of real-time location intelligence for reaching their objectives.</description>

        <description>We believe that production and maintenance of topographic data is convenient, fast and with less human error. Currently, a lot of time and human resources are spent checking the logic of topographic plans and their compliance with the specification. Therefore, we have created a Topographic Information Verification and Management Platform that provides the user for ease of use, adaptability, and increased productivity in topographic information verification and maintenance. The Topoweb.lv platform provides the verification of topographic and related data, the maintenance of data in the database and its release to users. We will present the current solutions and future development plans.

Maris Krievs has been a Member of the Board for TopoDati since 2014. Under Maris’s guidance, the development of a topographic data maintenance system was started. It did not take long when a service for automated verification of topographic data specification was offered in 2016. In 2017, automated release of data on territories of interest was introduced. In 2019, a topographic data logic verification system was introduced. In addition, a system has been developed for checking / comparing the survey data on public utilities against historical data in the database.</description>

        <description>Vector tiles is an emerging method for delivering base maps, that can be used on a web or mobile platforms on such devices as PCs, tablets, smart phones. Unlike raster maps, less centralised server processing power is required, since rasterization is performed directly in the client. This has become possible because of the growth in performance of clients’ devices. Since 2017, Jana seta Map Publishers had actively been seeking the best solution to create detailed vector tile maps, suitable for web and mobile apps.

        <description>Space based services, based on earth observation, satellite navigation, and satellite communication, are already strongly integrated into our daily lives. Geospatial Information Technology would be unthinkable without access to our resources in space, which is also the case for many other industrial sectors. In his presentation, Stefan Gustafsson will explain: - How ESA, through its Business Application programme, provides support and funding for development of innovative space based services. - How the ESA Business Incubation Network across Europe every year supports between one and two hundred new entrepreneurs helping them building successful companies from a space related idea. - How the ESA Technology Transfer Broker Network helps finding the space technology that is able to solve your needs.

Stefan Gustafsson has more than twenty years of experience in technology and applications development. Since 2009 he is working for the European Space Agency, initially he was responsible for development of innovative services using earth observation, satellite navigation, and satellite communication. Currently he holds the position of Business Incubation Officer, being responsible for ESA’s business incubation and technology transfer activities in a number of ESA’s member states and coordinating the network of ESA Business Incubation Centers. Stefan believes in the benefits of integrating Space stronger in society, “the innovation potential is enormous”. Stefan holds a Master of Science from Linköping University (Sweden) in Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering, and a PhD from Aachen University of Technology (Germany) in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology.</description>

        <description>Striking differences between the boundaries of villages defined by municipalities and actual distribution of population prompted Central Statistical Bureau to release statistics for densely populated areas of Latvia which is a new concept and an alternative to the existing administrative areas and territorial units, i.e., cities and villages. The presentation will provide an insight into the concept of densely populated area and describe population distribution in Latvia.

        <description>Data is the basis for the digital transformation of every institution, enterprise and economy. By digitizing processes and services institutions and companies are creating valuable data not only for themselves but also for others. Sharing data is a prerequisite for the successful digital development of society. The challenge is - how to make data sharing effective? The Latvian geo-portal Geolatvija.lv is the state's answer to this challenge in the field of geospatial information. What is Geolatvija.lv today and what is its development strategy on the way to a national marketplace of geospatial information?

Under Uģis Bisenieks lead the Latvian Population Register information system and implementation projects of public e-government sharing platforms were developed. Currently he leads Latvia's digital transformation strategy and implementation of a unified public administration ICT architecture.</description>

        <description>"Destination Lithuanian America" interactive online map ( http://map.truelithuania.com ) covers 600+ Lithuanian churches, monuments, famous burials, club buildings and other heritage in the Americas. Initially, this project may have seemed nearly impossible to pull off: it faced major budget and time constraints, while all the locations-to-be-mapped were far from Lithuania and most of them had no known coordinates or addresses. Nevertheless, the leader of the project Augustinas Žemaitis devised ways not only to complete the project on time and within budget, but also to nearly triple its scope. He explains how was it possible to efficiently collect such distant-yet-important data and map it.

Augustinas Žemaitis is a researcher and mapper of Lithuanian heritage abroad. He is the founder and author of 17 websites, among them http://global.truelithuania.com (encyclopedia of Lithuanian heritage abroad) and http://map.truelithuania.com (map of Lithuanian heritage in the Americas).</description>

        <description>Important aspects of cartography, like generalisation, are usually mostly overlooked in today's on-line maps. Some of these problems are being solved using open source tools while creating a vector tile based on-line map topo.openmap.lt. Cartography helps to improve not only the visual, but also the technical result of vector tiles and therefore the maps themselves. Although some solutions are already implemented, a lot of other issues are missing even ideas for high level algorithm to be used to solve them.

        <description>Should a free map be flat? How 3D-OSM came into beeing? Are "Simple Building" so simple? How it can be used? Are there any alternatives? When 4D and 5D will arrive?

Joined OSM eleven years ago and dug right in: made a conversion for a popular navigation tool and many useful validators. After presenting at many local and international conferences, took a break — to return with an avid interest for 3D.</description>

        <description>Mappost and Latvia`s State Forests have been working together on an innovative logistics solver engine project where OSRM technology is used for routing purposes. Timbertruck movement on roads is a much more complex issue than it is for other vehicles due to very practical challenges and specific business needs.

Rolands Rihters is a geospatial solutions development lead at the JSC Latvia`s State Forests with significant experience in developing complex GIS. Together with the team he is developing various geospatial solutions in many organizations in Latvia.

Aleksandrs Saveļjevs is an experienced software developer with a particular interest in algorithms and operations research, formerly a world TOP30 participant in numerous programming competitions.

        <description>Using OpenStreetMap sometimes feels like a dangerous affair because of its virus-like open license. Often there is little reason to worry: despite being complex, the license also allows quite a lot. Let's see what you can do without triggering a share-alike clause.

Ilya has been deeply interested in OpenStreetMap since 2010. He tried everything: mapped a lot, proposed tagging schemas, edited a blog and a telegram channel, made two podcasts, organized mapping parties and conferences, wrote JOSM plugins, API tools, editors, geocoders, and various maps.</description>

        <description>Ajapaik is a crowdsourcing platform for enriching the metadata of historic images. Since the beginning in 2011 the platform focused on geotagging and rephotography (then and now picture pairs). The aim is to enable map based access to historic pictorial content (instead of the usual textual search). Ajapaik has 175000 images, 106000 have been geotagged by users who have also submitted more than 16000 rephotographs. The talk will share our experience and prospects of how to use this data further.

Vahur Puik studied cultural geography in the University of Tartu, has worked as a photographer and then on positions related to exhibitions and photographic collections in several Estonian museums. He has been carefully following the global trends in digitising (photographic) heritage, participatory museum approach and crowdsourcing. Since 2012, Vahur has been dedicated full time to developing crowdsourcing platform Ajapaik.ee.</description>

        <description>Current state of Ukrainian open data ecosystem is at a fairly high level and has a tendency to increase, as confirmed by international rankings, such as Open Data Barometer. These achievements have been provided by adoption of The Open Data Charter and other international principles in this field at the national level but same time local governments show different speeds of open data concept implementation. In the presentation made an attempt to propose principles of building local communities` open data ecosystems met the goals of sustainable development and are a catalyst of innovative processes in the region.

        <description>The Soil Map of Estonia is a vector dataset that maps more than 750 000 soil units throughout Estonia at a scale of 1:10 000. It describes the soil type, quality, texture, and layer information with a series of complex text codes. However, these codes are not useful for quantitative large scale analyses. We present a standardised automated method to translate and standardise these text codes into numerical variables for depths, texture (clay, silt, sand components) and more.

        <description>Rapid changes in the environment and society, and fast developments in geospatial technology have increased the need for geospatial skills in many fields, e.g. environmental management, urban planning. This in turn will increase the demand for geospatial education. We will present some of the lessons learned from our Estonian and international MSc programme for Geoinformatics.

        <description>Road traffic collisions happen every day in densely built urban areas. One of the main tasks for traffic police is to gather all the needed evidence from collision scene and ensure that thorough investigation is being conducted afterward. The quality of the investigation is directly dependent of how realistically the collision scene is being reconstructed and how much time is being spent on data and evidence gathering on the scene. This presentation is focusing to compare traditional police data and evidence gathering practices with the new ones like drone RGB and IR camera as well as terrestrial scanner during road traffic collisions.

Andres Mumma is a former tactical level incident commander in fire/rescue services working there for the past 24 years and he left fire/rescue industry in autumn 2018 because he belives that GIS “revolution” inside public safety industry can be achived mainly through research and education. Starting from September 2018 he is the head of center of excellence at Estonian Academy of Security Sciences and focusing in the research, education, training and application of drones and remote sensing inside the public safety industry.</description>

        <description>It is estimated that heavy-duty vehicles (trucks) represent 30% of all road transportation, and 5% of all EU CO2 emissions. Therefore visibility, analysing, optimisations and reductions in commercial transportation footprint are not only useful to improve travel times and costs for businesses, but it also contributes to significant reduction of global greenhouse gases. This sector sees this as important target for the green future. My talk is technology-oriented view to the challenges of the first steps towards it: how small company started in Estonia now does collection and consolidation of billions of real-time locations of trucks, combines it with real-time traffic and GIS datasets and builds machine learning models to reveal hidden patterns and reduction opportunities.
