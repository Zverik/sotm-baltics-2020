Welcome to Riga! Yes, that's the city that hosts our next State of the Map Baltics
conference, inviting everybody from Baltic states and beyond to share their ideas
and experience related to OpenStreetMap. One date to remember: **6 March 2020**.
On that Friday, we will meet at the University of Latvia for a nice day of mapping-related
talks.

This SotM is a part of the [Baltic Geospatial Information Technology Conference](https://www.balticgitconf.eu/).
We cannot thank them enough for letting us borrow a room for OSM-related talks.
Which also means, if you get bored of these, you can attend any of the other
tracks to listen to more specialized topics.

We hope you've registered and booked your flight and hotel. Before you come,
there is some useful information you'd want to know:
