Welcome to Riga! Yes, that would be a city that host our next State of the Map Baltics
conference, inviting everybody from Baltic states and beyond to share their ideas
and experience related to OpenStreetMap. One date to remember: **6 March 2020**.
On that Friday, we will meet at the University of Latvia for nice day of mapping-related
talks.

There will be a great selection of speakers, and we invite you to be one of them.

[Please submit a talk!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdagp7tK60ElgQktNPzibRGl00PmTie2JM4HKQa_qB-NhBzw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

This SotM is a part of the Baltic Geospatial Information Technology [Conference](https://www.balticgitconf.eu/).
Which means, if you get bored of OSM talks, you can attend any of the other two
tracks to listen to more specialized topics. Also it means we've got a serious
conference and you have to register to attend:
