DESCRIPTION:Allan Mustard describes how OpenStreetMap changed lives for the
  better simply by creating a map of that country that anybody could use.\n
 \nAllan Mustard is a retired U.S. Ambassador as well as a long time OpenSt
 reetMap contributor. Since last December he is the chairperson of the OSM 
 Foundation board of directors. He was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to Turkm
 enistan on November 25\, 2014 and retired from that position in June 2019

 st few decades the technological and market/institutional environment has 
 changed considerably since the Spatial Data Infrastructure paradigm was fi

  will provide some thoughts which could possibly lead to the development o
 f a new paradigm. In the presentation Bruce will mention some geospatial t

DESCRIPTION:Ajapaik is a crowdsourcing platform for enriching the metadata 
 of historic images. Since the beginning in 2011 the platform focused on ge
 otagging and rephotography (then and now picture pairs). The aim is to ena
 ble map based access to historic pictorial content (instead of the usual t
 extual search). Ajapaik has 175000 images\, 106000 have been geotagged by 
 users who have also submitted more than 16000 rephotographs. The talk will
  share our experience and prospects of how to use this data further.\n\nVa

 graphic collections in several Estonian museums. He has been carefully fol

DESCRIPTION:Important aspects of cartography\, like generalisation\, are us
 ually mostly overlooked in today's on-line maps. Some of these problems ar
 e being solved using open source tools while creating a vector tile based 
 on-line map topo.openmap.lt. Cartography helps to improve not only the vis
 ual\, but also the technical result of vector tiles and therefore the maps
  themselves. Although some solutions are already implemented\, a lot of ot
 her issues are missing even ideas for high level algorithm to be used to s
 olve them.\n\nHead of Productivity engineering department at iTree Group w

DESCRIPTION:Space based services\, based on earth observation\, satellite n
 avigation\, and satellite communication\, are already strongly integrated 
 into our daily lives. Geospatial Information Technology would be unthinkab
 le without access to our resources in space\, which is also the case for m
 any other industrial sectors. In his presentation\, Stefan Gustafsson will
  explain: - How ESA\, through its Business Application programme\, provide
 s support and funding for development of innovative space based services. 
 - How the ESA Business Incubation Network across Europe every year support
 s between one and two hundred new entrepreneurs helping them building succ
 essful companies from a space related idea. - How the ESA Technology Trans
 fer Broker Network helps finding the space technology that is able to solv
 e your needs.\n\nStefan Gustafsson has more than twenty years of experienc
 e in technology and applications development. Since 2009 he is working for
  the European Space Agency\, initially he was responsible for development 
 of innovative services using earth observation\, satellite navigation\, an
 d satellite communication. Currently he holds the position of Business Inc
 ubation Officer\, being responsible for ESA’s business incubation and te
 chnology transfer activities in a number of ESA’s member states and coor
 dinating the network of ESA Business Incubation Centers. Stefan believes i
 n the benefits of integrating Space stronger in society\, “the innovatio
 n potential is enormous”. Stefan holds a Master of Science from Linköpi
 ng University (Sweden) in Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering\, and
  a PhD from Aachen University of Technology (Germany) in Electrical Engine
 ering and Information Technology.

DESCRIPTION:Using OpenStreetMap sometimes feels like a dangerous affair bec
 ause of its virus-like open license. Often there is little reason to worry
 : despite being complex\, the license also allows quite a lot. Let's see w
 hat you can do without triggering a share-alike clause.\n\nIlya has been d
 eeply interested in OpenStreetMap since 2010. He tried everything: mapped 
 a lot\, proposed tagging schemas\, edited a blog and a telegram channel\, 
 made two podcasts\, organized mapping parties and conferences\, wrote JOSM
  plugins\, API tools\, editors\, geocoders\, and various maps.
